# OR, if you want to install manually:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### 3. Run the Notebooks
Open Jupyter and run the notebooks:
```bash
jupyter notebook
# or
jupyter lab
```

Open and run:
- `Health_Risk_BMI_Prediction_uploadable.ipynb`
- `Smart_Resume_Screener_uploadable.ipynb`
